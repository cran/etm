	* New version number 0.5-1
	* CITATION: new file
	
2010-11-3 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* fourD : New data set
	* etmCIF and methods print, summary, plot: New functions
	Lead to add survival package in the dependencies
	* etm: Fixed warning message when no censoring but still defined in the call
	* etm and methods: Fix to deal with more complicated state names (e.g., 
	with characters with spaces)
	* vignette: A vignette on etmCIF has been added. Has a view towards CIFs for pregnancy data

	* lines.etm: New function

	* plot.etm: Rewritten. 
	Possibility to draw confidence intervals.

	* xyplot.etm: Consistency checking on tr.choice argument modified.

2009-8-21 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* Bug fix: in clos.cp and clos.nocp, O's were not in the right place for computing
	the weighted summary when P(X_s = 1) . P(X_s = 0) = 0

	* print.etm and print.summary.etm now return nothing,
	while before they returned x with the invisible flag set

	* Choice of the transformation for the confidence intervals 
	in the avec.cov function is now done with switch instead of
	using several ifs

	* Bug correction: Tests on the tr.choice argument in xyplot,
	trprob and trcov methods was done comparing it to the rownames
	of the covariance matrix, which didn't make sense when etm was 
	called with argument covariance set to FALSE, and thrown an error
	even if tr.choice was good.

2009-7-28 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* New function etmprep that transform data in the wide format
	into the long format, in a way suitable for using the etm function.

	* New generics trprob and trcov and methods for etm objects.

2009-6-12 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* New plot function for clos.etm objects

2009-6-9 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* New aw argument to clos. Whether use alternative weighting
	to compute the expected change in LOS
	* Implementation of the alternative weighting
	
2009-6-8 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* New argument to etm: delta.na which decides whether to include in
	the output the increments of the Nelson-Aalen estimator
	* Implementation of the Change of Length of Stay following changeLOS 
	package. Though here, it works with left-truncated data, and 
	doesn't require competing outcomes
	
2009-4-9 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>
	
	* New internal function ci.transfo() that transforms etm objects and computes pointwise CIs
	* Modification of summary.etm that now uses ci.transform
	* Modification of xyplot.etm. Uses ci.transform, and plots CI
	* New data set abortion

2009-2-4 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* bug correction

2009-1-9 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* Modification of sir.cont.Rd 

2008-12-9 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg>

	* Modification of print and summary
	new arguments
	* cov.dna now in C

2008-11-19 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>

	* Modification of the print an summary methods
	* Now result of summary is printed via print.summary.etm()
	* In etm: better handling when there's no event between (s, t]

2008-10-14 Arthur Allignol <arthur.allignol@fdm.uni-freiburg.de>
	
	* Bug correction: now works when there is only 1 transient state.
	* Modification of the part which transforms the data into counting process
	* Modification of the C++ routine
	that is now faster nd computes the increments
	of the Nelson-Aalen estimator
	* Add a plot function
